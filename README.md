# Yog-Sothoth-Nyarlathotep-Azathoth

Rock-paper-scissors but different.

**Yog-Sothoth** (defeats Nyarlathotep): Yog-Sothoth, the all-knowing and all-seeing cosmic entity, exists beyond time and space, encompassing infinite knowledge and possibilities. It supersedes the manipulative and cunning nature of Nyarlathotep due to its omnipotent nature.

**Nyarlathotep** (defeats Azathoth): Nyarlathotep, known as the Crawling Chaos, is an intricate and manipulative entity, capable of manipulating and influencing various beings. It can outmaneuver the chaotic and mindless Azathoth through its cunning and ability to control and manipulate situations.

**Azathoth** (defeats Yog-Sothoth): Azathoth, the blind, idiot god at the center of the universe, represents chaos and madness. Its chaotic and uncontrollable nature surpasses even the vast knowledge of Yog-Sothoth, as Azathoth exists as the chaotic core of existence and reality.

This relationship establishes a complex dynamic among the cosmic entities in which Azathoth's chaotic nature supersedes Yog-Sothoth's vast knowledge, Nyarlathotep's cunning outmaneuvers Azathoth's chaotic tendencies, and Yog-Sothoth's omnipotence transcends Nyarlathotep's manipulative abilities.
